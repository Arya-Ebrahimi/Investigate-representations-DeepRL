### Instructions on how to run and my bachelor thesis report will be added soon.

After cloning the repository, use the `environment.yml` file to create the conda env with approprate packages.

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate repdrl
```

or give it your desired name:

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml --name YourName
conda activate YourName
```

Refer to [my blog post](https://arya-ebrahimi.github.io/posts/fuzzy-tiling-activations/) for more information about FTA activation function.
